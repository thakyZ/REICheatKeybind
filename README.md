Adds a keybind to toggle cheat mode on or off on REI's item menu.

Keybind is `Numpad Divide` by default.

This is for minecraft version 1.16.2 I will think about making it for 1.16.1 as well soon.

Requires [Roughly Enough Items (REI)](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/roughly-enough-items)
